## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The number one learning I gained from this first frontend project was that it is better to continue to work on one section until it is fully completed instead of jumping back and forth between sections.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus my attention on achieving more scalable css as with this project I believe that I have some redundant code in my base.css file which could have been written more efficiently with a global approach, e.g. fonts. Also, I'd like to explore more thoroughly the differences between flexbox and grid and when to use which.
